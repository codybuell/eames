EAMES is a mission operations web application built on the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/).  Designed to consolidate disparate systems and ease the burden of documentation, EAMES aims to simplify data entry and analysis, and become a living evolving mission critical resource.  By consolidating data into one location, EAMES facilitates communication, report preparation, and keeps everyone from executive management to ground level operations on the same page.
